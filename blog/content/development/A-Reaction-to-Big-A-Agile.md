* Be in a good team
* Don't be in a bad team
* Talk
* No story points
* Only estimate is whether story is bigger than 2-3 days. If so, break it up
* No poker planning or sprint planning. Sprint length is just a regular checkpoint, not a scoping tool
* Count completed stories as velocity, not points
