Lots of common sense in your post :) Maybe so much some people cannot stomach
it. The reality is these little things like comments and variable names  are a
frequent cause for flame wars among developers. There is a category of coders
who pretend their code is too good to need comments. And always this statement
is pure BS. No code is clear or good enough taken out of the context of the
original development. Constraints, requirements etc. change in time to the
point where the original code seems dumb. If anybody is interested I wrote
some of my thoughts on how bad comments are born here:

Thanks for the good and entertaining read :)
