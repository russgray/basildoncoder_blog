Functional programming didn't lead you to the fastest solution since you
didn't get to the fastest solution.  Yours has a loop (recursion). My bc
solution (above) has none.  It also happens to be side-effect free and hence
functional.

My version takes a little bit of mathematical reasoning to come up with, or a
memory of the tale of Gauss summing the integers 1 to 50 too quickly for his
teacher http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/50686?&print;=yes
