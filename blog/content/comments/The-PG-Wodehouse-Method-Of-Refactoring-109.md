The technique is not new, I used to print indexes of source-code on matrix-
printers in "one dot per char" resolution back in the 1980ies.

An often overlooked feature of the original X11 Xterm program, is the ability
to select the "unreadable" font, which on a modern laptop easily displays
300-500 lines of sourcecode in one window.

Now, if only somebody gave vi(1) a multicolumn feature to take advantage of
the width of the screen also...
