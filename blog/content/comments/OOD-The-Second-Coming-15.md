Hi Russ,

Great post. I guess in the end it all comes down to "Use the best tool for the
job". And don't be afraid to mix things if it makes sense. It's also true that
OOP has it's merits and there are cases where OOP makes expressing your code
easier. Usually this is more visible on more complex cases than on simple
ones.

And finally about ASP.NET MVC ... i love it, even if a big part of it is using
extension methods witch are just syntax sugar for free functions. They make
perfect sense in the context.

Again, great post and great blog.
