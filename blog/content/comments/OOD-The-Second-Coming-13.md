Hi Sol,

I'd agree with you if all these frameworks were written in java or C#. My
degree required passes in courses using C++, 68000 assembly, Haskell (and,
yes, java), and I think it's a shame that so many degrees these days are so
narrow.

However, some of the worst culprits of the framework/OO lovefest are those
using python and ruby, both of which have reasonable functional constructs and
don't require you to use classes (well, not explicitly anyway). Yet still the
tunnel-vision remains.

It's particularly baffling given that Seaside's continuation-passing style is
a genuine improvement in handling complex multi-page interactions over mucking
around shuttling stuff to and from the model in typical MVC. Yet, as someone
on reddit pointed out recently, Seaside will probably be obsoleted soon by
increasingly powerful client-side javascript tools that solve the same
problems less elegantly but more fashionably. Shame.
