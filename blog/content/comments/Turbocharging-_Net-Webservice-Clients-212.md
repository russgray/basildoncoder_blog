Thanks for this. It boosted my call rate from 3 per second to 40 per second,
however I cannot get past 40 per second. Even if I open a new instance of my
app the calls per second equals around 20 per app, so I still have the max of
40 per second. Any thoughts or is that about as much as I could expect?

Thanks again for the great info.
