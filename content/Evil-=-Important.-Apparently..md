OK, I know I shouldn't even *acknowledge* spam blogs, but this one
amused me. Some filthy credit-crunch link bait site took an extract from
my [previous
post]({filename}/Project-Euler-Problem-3.md)
(this is obviously what happens when you say the phrase 'credit card'
... oops) and ran it though an automated word substitution program. The
result is fascinating. It turned this:  

> … you buy something from Amazon, you are protected by the fact that
> evil black-hats can't find the prime factors of your encryption key
> fast enough to steal your credit card number (OK, bit of a
> generalisation, but that's the gist). …
> </p>

<p>
into this:  

> … you take something from Amazon, you are secure by the fact that
> important black-hats can't connexion the matureness factors of your
> writing key alacritous adequacy to advise your assign calculate sort
> (OK, discernment of a generalisation, but that's the gist). …

Let's review the highlights. 'Buy' replaced with 'take', 'evil' replaced
with 'important', 'steal' replaced with 'advise'? Someone's book of
synonyms is bound in human hide with a skull on the front.
