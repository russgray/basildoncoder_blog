1. Quicksort (and mergsort) have nothing to do with being 'in-place' or not.
There are in-place versions of both (though in place merge sort is usually
called heap sort) and.... functional-friendly versions of both. :)

2. Understanding is very much bound with beuty.  When I used to read Smalltalk
code I thought it was awful because I didn't understand it (the same problem
Georgi has above).  After I learned the syntax and saw the elegance of what it
was doing it quickly became the most beutiful language I have ever seen.  Lisp
is high on that list as well, based on it's simplicity and elegance.

Things we don't understand we tend to see as *ugly*.  Especially when the
thing in question is from a domain we expect to understand.

You point about Italian opera misses the mark because for many who enjoy opera
they content is the sounds and visuals.  We understand very well what sites
and sounds are pleasing to us (though we probably wont know why).  Probably a
similar percentage of people watch opera for the plot as do for a porno.
