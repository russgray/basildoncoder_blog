I used to work with a guy at IBM in the 60's.  He would print out his code
(IBM Assembler by the way) and color code it with high lighters.  Conditional
code, green; subroutine calls, red; etc. you get the idea.  Then he would take
the listings and lay them out on the lawn of our building and view them from
the fifth floor.  He managed to gain many insights into how the code was
organized as he "refactored" (we didn't know that's what we were doing) the
code.

Old ideas never die, they just change shape.
