Your method can only be called utterly idiotic. Sooo all pages are hanging high! Cool!!! We have finished!!! Ohh look this class looks neater than this one... ohh surely it&#39;s bad quality code. WTF?!?!?<br /><br />How moronic. How do you tell a bubble sort from a quicksort from 10,000 feet above? Are you stupid? In fact the bubble sort will appear neater and shorter. Way to go!!
