Mr. Wizard: Actually my disk example was based on my dim recollection of Larry Niven&#39;s description of an Alderson disk (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alderson_disk).  The claim (which I am not mathematician enough to evaluate) is that if 1) the disk is wide enough in proportion to its thickness and 2) you are small enough in relation to the disk and 3) far enough from any edge, that the gravitational effect is roughly as though the disk has no edges at all.  But it&#39;s nothing I&#39;m an authority on, and nothing to do with cleaning up legacy code anyway. :)
