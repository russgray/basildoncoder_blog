I quote &quot;C# could solve problem 1 very neatly - can it keep up the pace in problem 2? Actually, yes it can, after a fashion.&quot;<br /><br />While efficient writing is one thing, what happens when the code hits the silicon?  Do they compile efficiently?  Does the processor run faster with one snippet over another?<br /><br />Many get spoiled by GHz machines with GB of RAM, but those of us in the embedded market still worry about code size and execution speed...<br /><br />J
