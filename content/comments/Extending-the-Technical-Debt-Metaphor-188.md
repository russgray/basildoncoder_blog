While I like idea of the product team owning the debt, unfortunately all to often they don&#39;t pay the price for debt overload, at least not directly in a way they understand. Frequently the development team pays the price through things like late night support or pager duty due to low-quality rushed into production code.<br /><br />Like any metaphor, technical debt has its limits.
