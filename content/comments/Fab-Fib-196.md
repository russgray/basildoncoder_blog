Hi Don, thanks for the link! The parallel implementations are interesting,
though they seem to me to be more an exercise in demonstrating Haskell's
parallel capabilities since they stick to the naive recursive approach. What I
love about the zipWith solution is how it performs so well whilst retaining
most of the elegance of the naive recursive solution.
