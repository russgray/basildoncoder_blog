-regards to all

,what is important is that your code flows smoothly and it is according to your algorithm and most especially you can predict wether  you can maximize its capability and upgrade its limitation. Thats how beautiful your work is, your programme!

,other than that, can someone analyze the program that i developed it is a sorting algorithm. I made this program not to surpass the quicksort but since im in the process i used to attempt surpassing the fastest quicksort. Now i already finished it and based from the demonstrations and observation it is many times faster than the quicksort. I still want somebody who really knows how to evaluate so that i am confident that my algorithm was beautiful.

, thanks
