How beautiful is the code is important, because it makes the difference between programming languages. If the code is beautiful, it is readable and maintainable and vice versa. Lisp and Smalltalk have many virtues but ugly looking code and are unsuccessful and always will be. C, C++ and Perl have a bit less, but still ugly code and their popularity goes down. Java, C#, Ruby and Python have more beautiful code and their popularity is on the increase.
