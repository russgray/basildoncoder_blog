Let&#39;s not forget the other two.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke&#39;s_three_laws<br /><br />1: When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.<br />2: The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
