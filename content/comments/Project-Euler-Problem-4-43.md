I don't see why you just don't check the string directly to see if it is a palindrome.  Unless I'm missing something, it's exactly the same complexity as your C string reverse function up there, conceptually cleaner, and more efficient.  Obviously the reverse thing makes more sense when you've got the  fancy language and you care more about the programmer's efficiency than you do about the program's efficiency....
