I don&#39;t see why you just don&#39;t check the string directly to see if it is a palindrome.  Unless I&#39;m missing something, it&#39;s exactly the same complexity as your C string reverse function up there, conceptually cleaner, and more efficient.  Obviously the reverse thing makes more sense when you&#39;ve got the  fancy language and you care more about the programmer&#39;s efficiency than you do about the program&#39;s efficiency....
