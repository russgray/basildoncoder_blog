30,000 lines of code doesn't qualify as large IMHO.

The source tree I primarily work on at work at the moment is roughly 150,000
lines of code - although metrics like that tend to de-value the actual content
of the code.  In our case, we're dealing with a CMS written primarily in PHP
and regular expressions with a lot of compacting done (read: each line is
fairly complex).

I've done a similar comparison in the past where I took screen shots of code
at an un-readable level.  I took two screen shots: 1) before and 2) after.
Sometimes a bird's eye view is just what the doctor ordered.
