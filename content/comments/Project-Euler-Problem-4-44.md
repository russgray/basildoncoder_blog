You're right, but I should point out that programmer efficiency - or more
specifically expressiveness - is indeed what I am interested in here. The goal
of this series is to complete a solution to each problem in multiple
languages, and evaluate the solutions subjectively.

Of course, the language choice is fairly arbitrary for each post (bar C#,
which I'm currently coding for a living and therefore tends to pop up a lot)
so I don't claim this will be anything definitive. It's more an exploration.

Actually, I've missed a fairly obvious final step here to increase
expressiveness further, which I'll do a separate post on later.
