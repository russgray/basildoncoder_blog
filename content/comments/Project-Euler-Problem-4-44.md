You&#39;re right, but I should point out that programmer efficiency - or more specifically expressiveness - is indeed what I am interested in here. The goal of this series is to complete a solution to each problem in multiple languages, and evaluate the solutions subjectively. <br /><br />Of course, the language choice is fairly arbitrary for each post (bar C#, which I&#39;m currently coding for a living and therefore tends to pop up a lot) so I don&#39;t claim this will be anything definitive. It&#39;s more an exploration.<br /><br />Actually, I&#39;ve missed a fairly obvious final step here to increase expressiveness further, which I&#39;ll do a separate post on later.
