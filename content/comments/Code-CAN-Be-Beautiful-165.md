"A non-Russian-speaker may not appreciate Russian poetry, but that doesn't

"the value of form is dependent on the content.

That is true, but of course one also has to understand the language in
question. And when one does, even speaks and writes multiple questions, there
are two points:

- how easy is the given language (write, speak, think)
- how beautiful is it

An algorithm will ultimately stay the same, but it does matter how it will
look in different languages. And there we are at languages which are just
plain ugly.

By the way, algorithm's are in itself quite beautiful but let's look at
reallife examples of code at work, like a somewhat-complicated task that is
done by code. To me, languages such as C or Java simply have less appeal than
say python.
