The &quot;â€˜bird's eye' view&quot; technique mentioned, well,<br />I figured out that&#39;s what the XTerm VT Font size (-MOUSE-3) &quot;Unreadable&quot; is useful for!<br /><br />There&#39;s an emacs package for zooming http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/zoom-frm.el<br />But won&#39;t zoom in close enough.  Nice to cycle through the font sizes though.<br /><br />As for zooming with OpenOffice, I find the text gets presented too fragmented and one also can&#39;t zoom in close enough (20%?).<br /><br />KWord works better for me.  One can zoom to 10%.  Don&#39;t need the Print Preview window: can zoom in the editing window.  The text isn&#39;t fragmented.<br />The pages are displayed in a single vertical column, which I find find most understandable presentation of linear flow.
