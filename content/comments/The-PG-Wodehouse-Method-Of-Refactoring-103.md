The "'bird's eye' view" technique mentioned, well,
I figured out that's what the XTerm VT Font size (-MOUSE-3) "Unreadable" is useful for!

There's an emacs package for zooming http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki
/zoom-frm.el But won't zoom in close enough.  Nice to cycle through the font
sizes though.

As for zooming with OpenOffice, I find the text gets presented too fragmented
and one also can't zoom in close enough (20%?).

KWord works better for me.  One can zoom to 10%.  Don't need the Print Preview
window: can zoom in the editing window.  The text isn't fragmented. The pages
are displayed in a single vertical column, which I find find most
understandable presentation of linear flow.
