Refactoring isn't a pain in the boss?

i've  refactored terrible code from prolog to msx basic, then to msx basic II
turbo, then to quick basic and to pascal.

I think i have enough bacground to discuss refactoring with my boss who
actually fired me for trying to explain him what refactoring means.

Now i am a jobless .net programmer. wanna work with me? i take some time to
refactor. when you work on legacy code your own brain refactors.!
