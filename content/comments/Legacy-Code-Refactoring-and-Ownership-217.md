Refactoring isn&#39;t a pain in the boss?<br />i&#39;ve  refactored terrible code from prolog to msx basic, then to msx basic II turbo, then to quick basic and to pascal.<br />I think i have enough bacground to discuss refactoring with my boss who actually fired me for trying to explain him what refactoring means.<br />Now i am a jobless .net programmer. wanna work with me? i take some time to refactor. when you work on legacy code your own brain refactors.!
