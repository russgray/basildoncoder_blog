Fortran IV -- Good examples from programming, bad one from physics. The
gravitational attraction from outside any object, regardless of its shape, is
toward its centre of mass.  On that disk, you'll only be able to stand upright
at the "poles" (the axis of the disk); anywhere else, the pull is straight
back toward the center, and you'll feel you're on the sheer vertical face of a
very tall, thin mountain. (Mr Pratchett's works are fantasy, not science
fiction. ;-) )
