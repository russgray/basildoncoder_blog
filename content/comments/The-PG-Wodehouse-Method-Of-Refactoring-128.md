Fortran IV -- Good examples from programming, bad one from physics. The gravitational attraction from outside any object, regardless of its shape, is toward its centre of mass.  On that disk, you&#39;ll only be able to stand upright at the &quot;poles&quot; (the axis of the disk); anywhere else, the pull is straight back toward the center, and you&#39;ll feel you&#39;re on the sheer vertical face of a very tall, thin mountain. (Mr Pratchett&#39;s works are fantasy, not science fiction. ;-) )
