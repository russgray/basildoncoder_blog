Nice idea about the zoomed-out view of code.<br />I&#39;ve written a fairly large project, EQUINOX-3D and I&#39;ve been keeping track of code quality by tracking which files and classes I&#39;ve code-reviewed on what date.<br />I usually do a code review on the affected files every time I add a new major feature or fix a major bug.<br /><br />This seems to work pretty well for me.<br />There about 4-5 known bugs at the moment in this project, which is approaching 400,000 lines of code.<br /><br />I&#39;ve never had to do a major re-factor or rewrite though.<br />Of course it&#39;s a lot easier to keep things clean, since I&#39;m the only developer on this project.
