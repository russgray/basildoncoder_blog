Nice idea about the zoomed-out view of code.

I've written a fairly large project, EQUINOX-3D and I've been keeping track of
code quality by tracking which files and classes I've code-reviewed on what
date. I usually do a code review on the affected files every time I add a new
major feature or fix a major bug.

This seems to work pretty well for me. There about 4-5 known bugs at the
moment in this project, which is approaching 400,000 lines of code.

I've never had to do a major re-factor or rewrite though. Of course it's a lot
easier to keep things clean, since I'm the only developer on this project.
