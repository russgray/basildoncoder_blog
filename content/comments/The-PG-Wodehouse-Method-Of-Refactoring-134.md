Hi

rewrites can be of great benefit, if the relevant sections of the legacy code
are recognized, documented and isolated.

Rewrites are necessary if the underlying technology changes significantly.
Like porting an application from java to erlang(like we do right now).

Also, on an abtract level rewrite != rewrite, distinguishing different classes
of "rewrites" is wortwhile.
