Hi<br /><br />rewrites can be of great benefit, if the relevant sections of the legacy code are recognized, documented and isolated.<br /><br />Rewrites are necessary if the underlying technology changes significantly. Like porting an application from java to erlang(like we do right now).<br /><br />Also, on an abtract level rewrite != rewrite, distinguishing different classes of &quot;rewrites&quot; is wortwhile.
