>You must see the point about the Russian poetry though.<br /><br />I do indeed see the point about the Russian poetry - I didn&#39;t see much that was beautiful about it either. I just believe that this isn&#39;t always the case. Some representations may lack beauty, but it doesn&#39;t follow that ALL representations lack beauty. The point of this post was simply to refute that statement by providing counterexamples.
