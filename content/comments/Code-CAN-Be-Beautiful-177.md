>You must see the point about the Russian poetry though.

I do indeed see the point about the Russian poetry - I didn't see much that
was beautiful about it either. I just believe that this isn't always the case.
Some representations may lack beauty, but it doesn't follow that ALL
representations lack beauty. The point of this post was simply to refute that
statement by providing counterexamples.
