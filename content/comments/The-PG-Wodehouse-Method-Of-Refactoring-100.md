Edge conditions are 'Gotcha' conditions, usually with a lower probability of
happening,and caused by obscure factors or interactions.  Not handling them
can result in nasty errors though.  Unfortunately one of the internal tools I
use (a cable modem provisioning system called "Bedrock") is a good example of
this, and provides no clean way to fix problems without escalation and
intervention with manual tools.
