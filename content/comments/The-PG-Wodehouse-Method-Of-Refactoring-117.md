I don't know anything much about writing code - except that my son is
programmer and I've picked up some interesting notes from him - but I couldn't
resist a post that included the venerable P G Wodehouse in it.   I've never
heard this story about him pinning up stuff before, but it wouldn't surprise
me.  He was a meticulous craftsman, which is partly why his books are still
being read.
