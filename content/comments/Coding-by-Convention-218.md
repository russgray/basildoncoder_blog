I think the article you wrote 5 years ago is still very relevant.  I am new to
Ruby on Rails and have been trying to learn this on my own searching for best
resources.  So many times I have been sure that I have followed along exactly
with the instructions only to be thwarted with an error that I do not
understand nor how to resolve it.  I have made some of them go away for
stopping and restarting the server and while that sometimes works it doesn't
always  and then I am off to search on Stack Overflow through a maze of
confusing questions and answers that still leave me not really understanding.
Time now to get back to my sorcery and hope someday that I will truly
understand the magic of Rails.
