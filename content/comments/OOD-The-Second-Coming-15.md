Hi Russ,<br /><br />Great post. I guess in the end it all comes down to &quot;Use the best tool for the job&quot;. And don&#39;t be afraid to mix things if it makes sense. It&#39;s also true that OOP has it&#39;s merits and there are cases where OOP makes expressing your code easier. Usually this is more visible on more complex cases than on simple ones.<br /><br />And finally about ASP.NET MVC ... i love it, even if a big part of it is using extension methods witch are just syntax sugar for free functions. They make perfect sense in the context. <br /><br />Again, great post and great blog.
