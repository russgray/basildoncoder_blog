its seems that in .NET 3.5 the lines:<br /><br />BFGlobalService service = new BFGlobalService();<br />service.EnableDecompression = true;<br /><br />dont work, since there is no EnableDecompression Property anymore.<br />Im using the VS2008.<br /><br />What would be the proper way todo this in .NET 3.5
