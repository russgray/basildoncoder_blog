> Refactoring is good. Everyone knows that.

This is called an argumentum ad populum logical fallacy. Logical fallacies are
very prolific in hyperbolic material such that which purports refactoring as
anything but a perversion of science.

There exists one person who doesn't "know that Refactoring is good" and
actively refutes the truth value of this statement (it is so false that the
inverse is true). I wrote an article titled Refunctoring quite some time ago;
I'&#39;'ll happily support my position with evidence and reason upon request.

I bring this to your attention so as not to continue the proliferation of
mythology and mislead potentially innocent bystanders into a similar state of
delusion.
