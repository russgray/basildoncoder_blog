Ah, how we programmers LOVE to refuse to separate our concerns!  ;-)<br /><br />All the quibbling about programming language preferences and &quot;I can write that function in fewer characters&quot; puts me in mind of the book <i>Strictly Speaking</i> by Edwin Newman. Written in the immediately-post-Watergate era, the book is a wonderful extended lament on the difference between elegant ideas expressed in homely fashion (with examples from Yogi Berra, Casey Stengel, etc. IIRC) vs empty ideas expressed in flowery language (most of the politicians and advertisers of the day).<br /><br />I&#39;d also recommend <i>The Crystal Goblet</i> by Beatrice Warde for the same principles applied to typography. (See http://gmunch.home.pipeline.com/typo-L/misc/clar.htm for discussion.)
