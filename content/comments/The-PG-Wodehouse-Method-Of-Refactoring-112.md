Wooster: I say Jeeves, have you solved the refactoring problem yet?<br />Jeeves: I have given it my fullest attention sir, and I believe I have come up with a satisfactory solution. A mere pinning up of the printouts should provide the necessary perspective that would lead the problem to a most effective conclusion. As the poet would say...<br />Wooster: Never mind the poet Jeeves! The plan is a washout!<br />Aunt Dahlia: Jeeves! You&#39;re a marvel! Bertie, you must pin up at once!<br />Wooster: I shall do nothing of the kind! Not all the soda Jeeves!<br />Aunt Dahlia: Pin up you shall Bertie, or no more of Anatole&#39;s meals for you!<br />Wooster: But Ancient A... Be reasonable...<br />Aunt Dahlia: Not one more bite Bertie! And may an Aunt&#39;s curse befall you if you do not do it.<br />Wooster: Oh very well then. Jeeves, if you&#39;ll be so good as to prepare the printer and procure a pot of the necessary thumbtacks.<br />Jeeves: I have already taken the Liberty Sir! You shall find the items in the workroom.<br />Wooster & Aunt Dahlia Together: Jeeves! You stand alone!<br />Jeeves: Thank You Sir! Thank You Madam! One endevours to give satisfaction.
