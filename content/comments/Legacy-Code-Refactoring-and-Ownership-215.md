&quot;I bring this to your attention so as not to continue the proliferation of mythology and mislead potentially innocent bystanders into a similar state of delusion.&quot;<br /><br />The phrase &quot;everyone knows that&quot; was intended to be slightly tongue-in-cheek, which I had hoped would be picked up by being unnecessarily sweeping and all-encompassing. Generally speaking I think it&#39;s a good thing, but I also think Steve Yegge hit the nail on the head when he said that refactoring had become the <a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/transformation" rel="nofollow">goal rather than the cure</a>.<br /><br />I read your <a href="https://tonymorris.github.io/blog/posts/refunctoring/" rel="nofollow">Refunctoring</a> article and largely agree with it; I code C# for a living and often find myself edging towards a functional style for certain problems. However, I think you&#39;re a bit strident; not all refactoring is simply a progression towards using map, foldr, and filter; similarly, I think you&#39;re overly harsh on Java and C#. C# at least is moving in interesting directions - LINQ is providing something very similar to (if more verbose than) Haskell&#39;s list comprehensions, and also now supports lambdas and a form of type inference. Whilst it&#39;s never going to be as much fun writing C# as it is to write Haskell or Ruby (which are my preferred languages outside the office, along with Ocaml), it&#39;s encouraging that such a mainstream language is starting to &quot;get it&quot;. <br /><br />I hold my hand up and concede that my phrasing didn&#39;t really communicate any of this. Sorry. I&#39;m just getting used to blogging and realise I need to be careful about how people interpret my writing.
