You can do some fancy functional stuff without leaving Perl, if you&#39;ve got the stomach for it ;-) Try the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~lbrocard/Language-Functional-0.03/Functional.pm" rel="nofollow">Language::Functional</a> module from CPAN, which gives you map, foldl, filter, take, and lots of other fundamental functions, though it doesn&#39;t really approach something like Haskell or F# (so you might find it tricky to emulate the pipeline of the F# solution above).
