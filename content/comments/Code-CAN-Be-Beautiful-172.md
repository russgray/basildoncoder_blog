Well said, of course representation can be beautiful!<br /><br />It&#39;s a chain of representation -- e.g. some code represents an algorithm, which in turn represents the tenets of some mathematical model, which in turn represents some aspect of the physical world.  Each step can be beautiful and/or ugly.<br /><br />It&#39;s not as if a piece of code was ever a perfect representation of an algorithm.  There are always interesting details of implementation which may have profound aesthetic effects on the results.
