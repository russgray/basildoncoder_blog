Back in October, personal finance blogger Trent at [The Simple
Dollar](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/ "The Simple Dollar") started an
[online book
club](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/10/30/your-money-or-your-life-final-reflections/ "Your Money Or Your Life Book Club")
for one of his favourite finance books. Good idea, I thought, so I'm
nicking it. Starting in January, I'm running a technical book club at
work with a few .Net devs, and I'll write everything up and post it
here, so if you're so inclined you can follow along at home.

To start with, we'll be reading language-agnostic books covering the
fundamentals of software development in the real world, since it's
always valuable to refresh knowledge on the cornerstones of modern
professional coding; later on this can diversify into specific
technologies and subjects with more arcane, academic, or abstract
overtones. Another benefit of starting with the basics is that we can
concentrate on getting the format right without feeling overwhelmed by
unfamiliar material.

So, the initial batch of texts will cover object-oriented design, design
patterns, refactoring, code quality, and so on. Later, the idea is to
study less immediate (but still vital) subjects like functional
programming, compiler design, operating systems, etc.; and also to gain
deeper knowledge of common specific technologies, e.g. the inner
workings of the
[CLR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime "Common Language Runtime")
or a [JVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jvm "Java Virtual Machine"). I
suspect people like
[stevey](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/ "Drunken Blog Rants") will
[argue](http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/blog-rants "Drunken Blog Rants 2004/5")
that these latter subjects are more important than the others and should
be done first, and they might even be right, but I've picked my approach
and I'm sticking with it, so nuts to you stevey.

So, here's the early schedule and probable books. The order we do these
books might change - in fact the books themselves might change if, for
example, we decide that Fowler's [*Enterprise
Patterns*](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321127420/ref=pd_sim_b_njs_title_4)
is more appropriate than the GoF's [*Design
Patterns*](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-patterns-elements-reusable-object-oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=pd_sim_b_njs_title_1).
Each book will be agreed for certain in good time for it to be ordered
and delivered before the scheduled start date, obviously.

Topic | Book | Start Date
--- | --- | ---
OO Design | *[Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Oriented-Analysis-Applications-Addison-Wesley-Technology/dp/020189551X/ref=ed_oe_h)* | 14/01/2008
Design Patterns | *[Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-patterns-elements-reusable-object-oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=pd_sim_b_njs_title_1)* | 03/03/2008
Refactoring | *[Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Technology/dp/0201485672/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b)* | 05/05/2008
Code Quality | *[Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pragmatic-Programmer-Andrew-Hunt/dp/020161622X/ref=cm_lmf_tit_3_rlrsrs2)* | 07/07/2008
Legacy Code | *[Working Effectively With Legacy Code](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1196701867&sr=1-1)* | 01/09/2008

In addition to these, we'll also cover one chapter of *[Code Complete](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1196701436&sr=1-1)*
per week. So, there it is. If you want to tag along, get yourself a copy
of Booch's *[Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Oriented-Analysis-Applications-Addison-Wesley-Technology/dp/020189551X/ref=ed_oe_h)*
and McConnell's seminal *[Code Complete](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1196701436&sr=1-1)*,
and tune in next month.
