Title: Descent Into Incompetence

I am fairly heavily involved with recruitment where I work, being the
author of the technical test and phone screen questions we use for
evaluating candidates, and conducting face-to-face interviews with many
of the hopefuls that get over these early hurdles.

Naturally, in order to gain these responsibilities I have gone through a
number of required HR ass-covering exercises in which it was drilled
into me that I am legally forbidden from asking questions about
sexuality, marital status, family-planning, and anything else which
might lead me into rejecting a candidate on grounds our beloved
government considers discriminatory.

Never mind that I have never shown the least inclination to discriminate
against someone because they might want to possibly think about maybe
taking some [mp]aternity leave in the next 30 years, or (gasp) prefer
the company of their own gender, or whatever; I have to go through all
this training so that the company can throw me to the wolves if a
candidate claims to have been discriminated against. "Not our fault,
guvnor; we explained the rules".

Still, fair enough I suppose; we live in litigious times, and not being
a bigot I have no particular fears of transgressing.

But what if the rules are changed? And what if they're changed in
horribly unexpected ways? A [recent article][1] on the BBC
News site contained, quite without fanfare, some shocking intelligence.

> Previously standard questions about age, length of experience and
> religious views are now illegal, Which? points out.

Wait, what? Length of experience is now a forbidden topic? So if I'm
recruiting a senior developer or team lead, I now have to waste valuable
time interviewing fresh-out-of-college tyros who haven't written a
single line of commercial code or spent a single day working in a
professional team?

I can kind of see what is trying to be achieved here, but it is an
unavoidable fact that experience is a *vital* attribute for many senior
roles, and needs to be taken into consideration when trying to fill
those roles. It's not just me either - a quick trawl through the endless
agency emails I seem to get every day (despite telling them I'm not on
the market) reveals that most tech jobs are still specifying *n* years
of experience; this seems somewhat pointless now that candidates can't
be asked about it. I wonder if they know?

Even more interesting is the fact that many contract positions are still
paid at 'rates negotiable on experience'. Hah, how does that work when
experience is a forbidden subject? If I were graduating from university
this year I'd be whoring myself around the City applying for
Â£500-per-day contracting gigs and suing any bank that dared ask me to
justify my rate.

Rob Grant's novel *[Incompetence][2]* just became slightly less hysterical.
