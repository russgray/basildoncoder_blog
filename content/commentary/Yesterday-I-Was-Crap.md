There's a very common meme in the tech world which has always struck me as the programmer equivalent of telling your classmates how easy you found that exam you all just took. It's stupid bravado and serves no purpose other than trying to make people feel bad. You'll recognise it as a variation on the following:

> If you look at the code you wrote 6 months ago and don't think it's crap, you're not growing as a programmer. 

It's bullshit, and I'm calling it out. Sure, you might look at code you wrote 6 months ago and realise there are improvements you could make, or a better way to do it, but don't feel bad if you don't think it's crap. When I look back at old code I may see ways I could improve it, but it normally holds up ok given the older version of the language I was using, the now-obsolete libraries I depended on, the time constraints I was under. Give your younger self a break, not everything they did sucked.
